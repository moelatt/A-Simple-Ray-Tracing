	step(1): enter ==> " make " <== to compile

	step(2): enter ==> " ./a.out " <== to run the program
	
	step(3): Enter ("y" or "n") to modify Ir, kr, and Transparent. 'y' mean yes and 'n' mean no.

Default value: 
	Ir (reflection value) = 1, Kr (light scaler value) = 2.5, Transparent = 0.4
The lesser value you input for Ir, Kr, and Transparent, you will see lesser reflection and transparent and light value.

When you enter "y" in command line, it will ask you to input the value for Ir, Kr, Transparent.
example: 	
	Enter Ir: 0.5
	Enter Kr: 0.9
	Enter Transparent: 0.6 (range 0 to 1)
    

Program will display approximately in 1 to 3 seconds.
